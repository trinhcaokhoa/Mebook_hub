                <p>It is a fact that knowledge and books are inherently linked. In modern life, for students and researchers, reading
                    ebooks is considered as a means to study and work, which has replaced reading thick books. 10 years ago, bookshelves
                    with good books could be a pride. However, with the advent of ebooks, people could only store them
                    as pdfs in digital drives. Stemming from that inspiration, MeBook.hub wishes to become a place to store and display
                    ebooks in a colorful way. Besides, with MeBook.hub, users can also comment, rate, search and download suitable ebooks
                    without having to pay. Above all, there is a belief that knowledge is free.
                    <br> <br> Best regards.

                <p>Born from a passion for reading as well as fond memories of bookshelves from childhood, MeBook.Hub hopes that the value
                and beauty of ebooks will be honored in the right way. Along with that, the free sharing of useful ebooks is also a
                noble goal that MeBook.hub aims to. Hopefully, with the reviews and comments on the books available on MeBook.hub, users
                will have the best experience in the process of expanding their knowledge.</p>
