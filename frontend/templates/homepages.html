                <p>It is a fact that knowledge and books are inherently linked. In modern life, for students and researchers, reading
                ebooks is considered a means to study and work, which has replaced reading thick books. 10 years ago, bookshelves with
                good books could be pride. However, with the advent of ebooks, people could only store them as pdfs on digital drives.
                Stemming from that reason, MeBook wishes to become a place to store and display ebooks in a colorful way. Besides, with
                MeBook, users can also rate, search and download suitable ebooks without having to pay. Above all, there is a belief
                that knowledge is free.
                    <br> <br> Best regards.

                <p>Born from a passion for reading as well as fond memories of bookshelves from childhood, MeBook hopes that the value and
                beauty of ebooks will be honored in the right way. Along with that, the free sharing of useful ebooks is also a noble
                goal that MeBook aims to. Hopefully, with the reviews and ratings on the books available on MeBook, users will have the
                best experience in the process of expanding their knowledge.</p>
